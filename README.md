# Factoromer

Attempts to predict the TFs which play the most important roles in determining a cells identity.

basically you use TFomeBase or put together your own database of pseudoaligned files, or query ARCHS4, and then this code shoves it into an ML model and runs LOCALLY on your machine.

You can run it on an HPC if you'd like.
